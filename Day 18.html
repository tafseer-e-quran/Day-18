		<h1>TAFSEER OF THIS SURAH</h1>

		<p style="border-radius: 0;">In the previous Surah (Fil) the story of the destruction of the possessors of the elephant and Abrahah's army, who came to Mecca intending to destroy the Ka'ba and obliterate that Sacred House, was stated. In the first verse of this Surah which is, in fact, the supplement to it, followed to the idea that
			<br><br>
			<i >'We destroyed the companions of the elephant and made them like straw eaten up'</i>
			<br><br>
			before the advent of the Prophet of Islam. <br><br>

			Some have construed / ilaf/, deriving from another root, to mean 'agreement, compact' which is not appropriate with the content of the Surah. So, the purpose of using it is for the familiarity and union amongst the Quraish tribe who, together with all the citizens of Mecca, had settled there because of the honour, importance and security of the Holy Ka'ba for which, every year, many people from Arabia and the Arabian Peninsula came to that city for pilgrimage, also taking profit from some commercial and literacy exchanges.
			<br><br>
			All of them were obtained under the existence of that peculiar security.
			<br><br>
			If the army of Abrahah, and the like, could have disturbed the security or were successful in destroying the Ka'ba, no other people would become familiar with the region.
			
			<br><br>
			The purpose of the unifying and familiarity of the Quraish may be due to their love for their sacred land. The political and economical importance of the Holy Shrine (Ka'ba), for the Quraish, then secure from the invasions of the hostile tribes in the Arabian Peninsula thus made them monopolize the trade of the area from the North to the South and vice-versa.
			<br><br>
			In the summer, they used to go to Syria which had moderate weather and in winter to Yemen where they enjoyed a warm climate, for the purposes of trade, and it was by Allah's Grace that they travelled safe and undisturbed on their journeys, otherwise, the routes were not safe and none could travel without being plundered and suffering death and destruction or suffering heavy losses. (Of course, for the same love, they did not leave Mecca to settle in these places).
			<br><br>
			It was the position of the Quraish with regard to their connection with their services to the Holy Ka'ba that they received, by the Will of Allah, the security and honour from the people. He planned to keep them safe, by His Grace, for the advent of Islam and the holy Prophet (S) to emerge from that tribe and in that sacred land.
			<br><br>
			But, the same tribe, the Quraish, whose protection, safety and honour was due to the Holy Ka'ba being in their city and they being its guardians, later became the prime enemies of Islam.
			<br><br>
			At the beginning, the main cause of their opposition, to the advent of Islam, was the fear of losing their supremacy in the political and economical fields; and later, vices in different forms were committed by the Ommayyid and Abbaside Kalifs who were of the Quraish tribe, for other worldly motives. They were so hideous that history will never forget them, although all of whatever they had, were from Islam; the command of Allah.
			<br><br>

			When the Quraish had been granted such great blessings; security in trade for gaining profit and in life for being honoured, they should have gratefully worshipped the Lord of the Ka'ba, Who, inspite of their land being only a desert and thus unproductive, provides them with every kind of good food and the other provisions of life, through merchandise and the pilgrimage, which is brought to their very door. And Allah had protected them from the most formidable enemy, Abrahah.
			<br><br>
			This was an open admonition to the Quraish who, at the start of the ministry of the holy Prophet (S), had been the most persistent enemies of the apostle of Allah and the message of the Unity of the Lord which he preached. It was as well as a warning inviting their attention to the Mighty power of Allah Who could also destroy them and humiliate them as He did with their mighty foe, Abrahah.

		<h1>LESSON <br> [MORAL]</h1>

		<p style="background-color: rgba(172, 255, 47, 0.432); border: 1px solid green; text-align: left;">
			Allah (SWT) reminded Quraysh of His favour and blessings upon them. He secured and fed them 
			out of hunger. Muslims learn that they should keep in mind that their security, food, and all their worldly affairs 
			are in the hands of Allah Almighty. They shouldn't fear anyone other than Allah (SWT). Also never take the 
			blessings of Allah for granted. Always show gratitude by remaining obedient to Him. This surah also tells us the importance 
			of business / trade. For economic development and fulfiling needs [Hunger, security, etc], Allah encouraged Quraysh towards
			business / trading instead of slavery / jobs. If someone wants to achieve their goals in life than they should prefer
			 business over jobs [in modern time] except for some places, for example, if you are working in Madarsa or Army or Teacher, etc. 
		</p><br><br>

		<h1>BENEFITS & VIRTUES <br> OF RECITING SURAH QURAYSH</h1>

		<p>
			<b>Prophet Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him) said:</b>
			<br><br>
			“The one who recites this Surah will get the reward of ten times the number of people performing Tawaaf and I’tikaf.”
		</p><br>

		<p>
			Some benefits of this Surah are: <br><br>
			<b>1.</b> To ward off the evil eye, sorcery, or dangerous adulteration in the food, it is read three times before eating meals, followed by Bismillah. <br><br>
			<b>2.</b> recited often in a business or store, it attracts wealth and blessings. <br><br>
			<b>3.</b> recited 11 times after Isha prayers, it works as relief from illness. <br><br>
			<b>4.</b> When recited 70 times after Fajr prayers daily then dua is made to Allah SWT for provisions, it ends poverty and misery. <br><br>
			<b>5.</b> Surah Quraish is often recited for travel safety. <br><br>
			<b>6.</b> The recital of Surah Al-Fil and al-Quraysh in the obligatory prayers (Salah) is highly rewarded. <br><br>
			<b>7.</b> If a kid is afraid, read it 41 times on the water and hand it to him, then his fears shall go away. <br><br>
		</p>

		<br><br>
		<p style="background-color: rgba(172, 255, 47, 0.432); border: 1px solid green; text-align: center;">
			Congragulations! You have completed your Seventeenth day task. Revise thoroughly what we have taught you above. Memorize the above Surah with its translation and tafseer and make sure 
			to recite it as much as possible.
